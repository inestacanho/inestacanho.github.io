This project was created as part of the 02806 Social Data Analysis and Visualization at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). Our team - whcih includes Inês Tacanho: (s232669), Raquel Marques (s243636) and Sree Keerthi Desu (243933) - has analyzed SF Crime Data to uncover meaningful insights and trends.

## What You’ll Find Here

- Introduction to the Dataset: A brief overview of the SF Crime Data and its significance.

- Three Key Visualizations:
    * A time-series or bar chart to showcase trends over time.
    * A geographical map to visualize crime distribution across the city.
    * An interactive Bokeh visualization offering deeper exploration of the data.

- Analysis & Context: Our interpretation of the data, complemented by external sources where relevant.

This project follows a magazine-style storytelling format and is hosted on GitHub Pages (the GitHub page is linked [here](https://github.com/inestacanho/inestacanho.github.io)). Visualizations were created using tools such as Matplotlib, Bokeh, and Folium.
